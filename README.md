# Hello Terraform

My first look at terraforms

In this project I attempted to create a reuseable template that can be reused  and extended as required.
The technologies, platforms and tools used here include AWS free tier accounts, terraforms, terragrunt and visual studio code.

More detail around project can be found here.
